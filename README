Spectrogram -


Confusing things/ Open questions
1. Use pylab or mlab specgram? Pylab plots with axes and mlab doesn't
2. Pydub data, decode in int32, or int16? Int16 seems to have a reflected version with strange missing frequencies. Int32 resembles audacity
4. Why does splitting channels seem to lose data? How do we split channels?
5. Will Drevo - http://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/ [ decodes int16, and doesnt label or correctly mark axes]
6. What frequency bins do we use for the Hz spectrogram? What about the mel-scaled spectrogram?



Specgram variables -
Fs - Use sample frequency - 44100
NFFT - The window width when doing FFT - typically 4096 works well
noverlap - The overlap between window widths - typically 0.5*NFFT
window - The filter applied on the window. Typically hanning? ref: wikipedia


Things to do -
1. Add script option to reprocess
2. Add one global SAVE_DIR
3. modularize
4. Idea - maybe use spectral envelope comparison like simple mean square error curve comparison to cut and patch songs like infinite jukebox?!
7. Maybe in the future use window size in seconds and then round to the nearest power of 2 (python prefers window sizes in powers of 2)

Accomplishments/Goals -
1. Detecting and fingerprinting Audio (like Shazam)
2. Recognizing Genre
3. Figuring out an audio signal similarity metric
4. Spectral envelope similarity to cut and patch songs (like Infinite Jukebox)
5. Speech recognition (!?!?)

Fun things learnt -
1. MP3 file format - ID3 tag header, MP3 frames <MP3 header, data>
2. Spectrograms
3. Fast Fourier Transforms
4. Nyquist sampling - if an audio signal is recorded at sampling rate f, the maximum possible frequency detectible is f/2
5. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients - Direct Cosine Transform as an approximation for a Karhunen-loeve (KL) transform or a PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
6. Cepstrums
7. Mel-filterbanks and conversion of spectrograms to mel-spectrograms
8. Spectral Envelopes
9. Python PIL matrix to image
10. FFmpeg for sample rate normalization
11. Different constraints on test data - 30 computers running for a month could do about 2.5 million songs, and that's over 12,000 GB of data. Spotify contains around 20 million songs.
12. Geoff Hinton's work on Speech Recognition -
battle between Gaussian Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models vs
Deep Neural Networks
13. Genre classification - MFCCs, other features, such as beat onset, etc,etc. Tzetekanis is the guru. Typical dataset is GTZAN. Highest accuracy is 92.6% using Sparse Representation Based Classifier and Compressive Sampling (SRC, CS). - http://ismir2010.ismir.net/proceedings/ismir2010-66.pdf
14. Unsupervised learning using SVMs worked okay with 83% - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/henaff-ismir-11.pdf
15. The seminal paper is http://ismir2001.ismir.net/pdf/tzanetakis.pdf
16. Compressive Sampling is a technique that Emmanual Candes came up with, also responsible for the Dantzig selector with Terence Tao.
